Overview:
This project is designed to predict IMDb movie scores based on various features and attributes. It uses machine learning techniques and a dataset of movie information to create a predictive model.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.6+
Required Python packages (install using pip):
pip install -r requirements.txt
numpy
pandas 
os
matplotlib
seaborn
bar graph
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Ram2612/KiranRam-N.gitInstall the required packages as mentioned in the prerequisites.
Data
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from source-link.

The dataset includes the following attributes:

Feature 1
Feature 2
...
Target (IMDb Score)
Please download and place the dataset in the data/ directory.
Usage:
Navigate to the project directory:
cd KiranRam-N
Train the model:
Predicting IMDb scores.ipynb
Make predictions using the trained model:
Predicting IMDb scores.ipynb
Model:
The project uses a machine learning model, specifically a [model_name], to predict IMDb scores. You can find the model implementation in the model.py file.
Evaluation:
We evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2). You can check the evaluation results in the evaluation.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
